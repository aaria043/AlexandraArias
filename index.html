        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science Major ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Alexandra Arias and I am currently a second year Political Science Major at the University of California Riverside. I hope to change my major from Political Science to Political Science Law and Society as I see it is more beneficial to my pre-law path than Political Science alone. I also hope to minor in Marketing as I am fascinated by the marketing realm and have held many marketing positions in my time at the university. 
<br><br>

        I currently work as a Residential Advisor for the Aberdeen Inverness Residence Hall and Community located near the center of campus and main entrance of the University. I enjoy my job a lot because of the benefits it brings to my life as a student as well the community, friendships and connections I have created since my time working here. I get to interact with my residents in my hallway on a daily basis, speak with them and help advise them on their time at the university as well as their time as a first year student. I hope to reapply for this position in the future as well as apply for higher positions such as the Assistant Resident Director Position that allows me more freedom and flexibility and entails more responsibility and opportunities in being an active member of the freshmen/ first year community. 

I am also an Associate Justice for Judicial Council which is part of the Associated Students of University of California Riverside organization on campus. In this position I act as an unbiased, and nonpartisan representation of the student body and aim to help expand the councilâ€™s jurisdiction and involvement of the university as a whole. This organization has grown to mean a great deal to me since I get to actively be involved with the organization so much as well as make so many new and meaningful connections and relationships with not just my fellow peers but also other individuals in positions of power off campus such as lawyers and judges as well as past seat holders of the university. 
<br><br>

        
Finally I also run my own business though it has been on hiatus for some time now since living in a residence hall makes it extensively hard and difficult to ship out items in a  timely fashion the way I was able to do while I was back home over the summer. I do continue to draw and take commissions and I do my best to keep up with them as well as school and work all while maintaining a social life but sometimes it can feel a little overwhelming. I am aiming at getting into a top law school which is the main reason as to why I take on so many duties, responsibilities and extra curriculars. I do enjoy art and all of the organizations I am a part of but I do sometimes wish I did not have so much going on so I could take a moment to simply enjoy my college expenses and life without always having the subtle yet overbearing reminder that I most likely have something due.
